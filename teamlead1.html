If we organize the community alone, there is no need to discuss with anyone what the steps should be. You can move fast. However, we may be left alone to decide a number of important issues.
If we start more work for him, it means slower progress in the beginning. Many times it has happened that due to impatience, the funds could not be laid. If one or two people join the organizing team who are some kind of implementing people and find it a waste of time to discuss the basics, think about the systems, and have a dialogue, they can come out and start making the community themselves. The community can then split in two, almost before it is formed. In our experience, self-appointed leaders are unfortunately unable to create a real community. Patience and empathy are therefore essential from the earliest times.
We suggest that if possible, more people start organizing. Let's take the time to get to know each other. Let’s look around the world at how shopping communities work and what their goals are. And let’s take the time for the entire team to have a desire to act.

The first task of the organizing team is to collect a second round around you. Producers, prospective buyers, volunteers, supporters.

We recommend that you organize more community discussions for this second round.

In these conversations, there should be an opportunity for the participants to introduce themselves and get to know each other. Let’s not immediately fall for organizing the shopping community because a group can only work if it goes through the stages of group formation. First, each person needs to clarify within himself who He is in this group. Then each participant needs to see who else is here and what their role might be. It is also important to develop some rudimentary norms that will define the framework for future work. Such a norm e.g. is that if we want to talk, we sign up and wait until we get in line, not the one who talks the most violently. These norms and earlier aspects of group formation are formed on a few conversational occasions.

Conversational occasions have an additional significance. Members of the wider group can also be committed to creating a shopping community. And this commitment develops when participants feel they are important to the group. They have a say, and they can learn from the others.

The first couple of meetings will decide if the people gathered together can form a group first. Becoming a community can happen when the group starts working together. We write about community formation in another material.

If enough action is gathered, you have to step into the field of action. It’s worth setting a deadline by which the shopping community will start working in practice. The deadline should not be too far away or unrealistically close in time.
