## Welcome to my GitHub Pages

I am Zoltan Gal,

Soon Full Stack Developer. :)

In the past 25 year I was work with Linux Servers as system administrator, and had also a few web projects where I was involved full or part time.

I will probably update the current gihub page to a portfolio - where I will highlite my previous works.

At the moment I created a responsive and mobile first/mobile friendly basic website for the idea of "cart - communities" = Short food supply chain (SFSCs) ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_food_supply_chains ).

The source of the project was the request from my friend Gabriel, and a Hungarian cart-community website : https://kosarkozosseg.hu/ .


I write here some of the issues I was facing through the build-process:

Gitpod - wont do the "git push" -- push back to the origin. COuldn't fin dthe reasaon why, but when searched Google - lots of other also claiming the same.

SO, I decided to do it on my windows laptop and will push with git desktop app.

There next issue - Github use relative path to files - XAMPP ( Apachefriend LAMP ) and localhost use direct - relative path to files/folders.

Therefore I had to duplicate my works - in every steps - if I want to see the changes without push to github / upload it, refresh 5-6 times after each upload ( probably cache/CDN overwrite slow ).


Its done and can be seen: 
http://unit45host.github.io  ( no SSL in 2020 .. ) 


I used some third party stylesheets, javascript sources to achieve the plan - an dspeed up devtime.

If you have any concerns, ideas, contructive criticism - please send me email : kukacka dot kukac at unit45host dot com .

Thank you,

ps.:


Well.. the theme - wasnt worked for me, so I created from scratch.
